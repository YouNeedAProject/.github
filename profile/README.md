# YouNeedAProject

[YouNeedAProject.com](https://YouNeedAProject.com) is a friendly community where you can learn project-based coding. QRG and volunteers run it to help millions of busy people solve problems while getting into tech.

Our full-stack web development curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have a growing list of interactive projects where you can challenge yourself to learn coding in the context of completing projects that interest you.

## Embracing Agile and Secure SDLC: YNAP Encourages Quality-Driven Efficient Software Development

Members of YNAP emphasize the importance of adopting Agile and Iterative practices in our software development processes. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework designed to produce high-quality, cost-effective software efficiently. Originating in the 1950s and 1960s, the SDLC has evolved to emphasize security and quality, integrating security measures throughout all phases.

Standardizing our development process aids in planning, estimating, and scheduling. We always want to increase quality development for the fastest process we can operate under to reduce risks and costs. 'Secure SDLC' leads to early prevention and detection of flaws, which reduces costs and time.

Agile focuses on continuous release cycles with iterative improvements, fostering better stakeholder engagement and issue resolution. The Iterative model similarly allows for developing software in cycles, adding requirements progressively.

Effective communication is vital for a successful SDLC. Alignment and collaboration across teams. Collecting requirements, analyzing requirements, and providing documentation to confirm what is being built is done to start a project.

Our strategy is to utilize open-source tooling and best practices to ensure a secure and efficient development process. 

## Documentation as Code

We see the code repository as the best place for documentation related to software development projects for several reasons:

1. **Centralized**: Keeping documentation in the same repository as the code ensures all project-related materials are in one central location. This makes it easier for team members to find and reference documentation when needed.

2. **Versioned**: Document changes are tracked alongside code changes. 

3. **Consistent**:  Consistency between the documentation and the codebase is key to knowing that communication is good. When code is updated, the accompanying documentation can be updated simultaneously, which helps ensure code is accurate and updates to one or both are done to ensure anyone reading the docs and code can spot gaps.

4. **Collaboration*: Similar to how code is reviewed, so should the docs. This collaborative approach improves the quality of the knowledge base.

5. **Documentation as Code**: Storing documentation in a repository supports the "documentation as code" philosophy, where documentation is treated with the same level of care as code. [Documentation as Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/)
