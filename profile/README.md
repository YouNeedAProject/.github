# YouNeedAProject

[YouNeedAProject.com](https://YouNeedAProject.com) is a friendly community where you can learn project-based coding. It is run by QRG and volunteers to help millions of busy people solve problems while getting into tech.

Our full-stack web development curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have a growing list of interactive projects where you can challenges yourself to learn coding in the context of completing projects that interest you.

## Embracing Agile and Secure SDLC: YNAP Encourages Quality-Driven Efficient Software Development

Members of YNAP emphasize the importance of adopting Agile and Iterative practices in our software development processes. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework designed to produce high-quality, cost-effective software efficiently. Originating in the 1950s and 1960s, the SDLC has evolved to emphasize security and quality, integrating security measures throughout all phases.

Standardizing our development process, aids in planning, estimating and scheduling. We want to always be increasing qualiity development for the fastest process we can operate under to reduce risks and costs. 'Secure SDLC' leads to early prevention and detection of flaws which reduces costs and time.

Agile focuses on continuous release cycles with iterative improvements, fostering better stakeholder engagement and issue resolution. The Iterative model similarly allows for developing software in cycles, adding requirements progressively.

Effective communication is vital for a successful SDLC. Alignment and collaboration across teams. Collecting requirements, analyzing requirements and providing documentation to confirm what is being built is done to start a project.

Our strategy is to utilize open source tooling and best practices to ensure a secure and efficient development process.
